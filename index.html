              "I had the privilege of working with Mehdi Karimian at StageMeta,
              where he was my Tech Lead. Mehdiâ€™s leadership, technical
              expertise, and mentorship inspired me from day one. He can break
              down complex problems into clear, actionable steps, transforming
              even the most daunting tasks into achievable goals. His extensive
              knowledge of backend development, distributed systems, and
              blockchain technologies was pivotal in our projects' success. More
              importantly, he nurtured a collaborative and supportive
              environment, always dedicating time to guide and empower the team.
              Beyond his technical brilliance, Mehdi is a strategic thinker who
              beautifully balances innovation with pragmatism, ensuring that
              solutions are practical and sustainable. Working alongside him was
              an enlightening experience and a true inspiration. I
              wholeheartedly recommend Mehdi to any team seeking a skilled,
              thoughtful, and visionary leader. He would undoubtedly be a
              tremendous asset to any organization."

              learner, open to new technologies, and care about delivery and
              very result-oriented. He really cares about business side of
              projects and achieving successes in marketing and sales part of
              each product, which is very interesting for me as most of
              developers are not curious or interested about what is going on on
              the sales side. I would recommend Mehdi if you have something to
              challenge and opportunities for learning and grow."

              Talentbridge, collaborating on several project teams. Mehdi's
              ability to handle multiple projects was unlike any Iâ€™ve seen
              before and made a dramatic increase in the productivity level of
              our company. No matter how tense a meeting, Mehdi made sure
