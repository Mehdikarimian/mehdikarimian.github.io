              importantly, he nurtured a collaborative and supportive
              environment, always dedicating time to guide and empower the team.
              Beyond his technical brilliance, Mehdi is a strategic thinker who

              Mehdi. Mehdi was a great achiever and problem-solver. We worked
              together on several projects. I was impressed by his work. I am
              glad to have worked with him. Best wishes."

              "It is now a year Mehdi work for us at agileful. He is a fast
              learner, open to new technologies, and care about delivery and
              very result-oriented. He really cares about business side of
              projects and achieving successes in marketing and sales part of
              each product, which is very interesting for me as most of
              developers are not curious or interested about what is going on on
              the sales side. I would recommend Mehdi if you have something to
              challenge and opportunities for learning and grow."

              "Mehdi and I worked in the same team, I know him as an expert in
              Nodejs, React, DevOps, and a very serious team player. His ability
              to work on multiple projects and yet be focused is a very rare
              skill to master. From my past experience, I can easily say that a
              problem assigned to Mehdi is considered perfectly solved. Mehdi
              showed exceptional skills on problem-solving, learning new tech
              and domain."

              "I rarely come across real talents who stand out like Mehdi. I had
              the pleasure of working with Mehdi for 1 years at the
              Talentbridge, collaborating on several project teams. Mehdi's
              ability to handle multiple projects was unlike any I’ve seen
              before and made a dramatic increase in the productivity level of
              our company. No matter how tense a meeting, Mehdi made sure
              everyone left with a smile. As a team member or a leader, Mehdi
              earns my highest recommendation."
